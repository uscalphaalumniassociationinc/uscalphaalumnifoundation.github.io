    <h2>Igniting Hope, Building Futures</h2>
    <p>Education is the key that unlocks countless possibilities. Yet, for many Filipino children, this key remains out of reach. The USC Alpha Alumni Association Foundation is committed to changing that.</p>
    <p>Our nation's youth are its greatest asset. They are the leaders, innovators, and change-makers of tomorrow. However, systemic challenges, such as poverty and family incarceration, often hinder their potential.</p>
    <p>Project Alpha is our answer to this pressing issue. We offer scholarships for secondary education and vocational training to deserving students whose parents are currently deprived of liberty. By investing in these young minds, we are not only providing financial support but also nurturing hope, resilience, and a strong sense of purpose.</p>
